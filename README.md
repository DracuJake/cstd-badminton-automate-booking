# cstd-badminton-automate-booking
This small project automates the booking process for badminton courts at the CSTD by interacting with their API. The script monitors the availability of slots and automatically makes a booking, so users no longer need to wait and manually book via the mobile frontend. Simply run the script, and it will do the job for you.

## Features

- **Automated Booking**: The script waits for the available booking slot and automatically books it for you.
- **Multiple Courts**: Supports booking for 7 different badminton courts.
- **Time Selection**: Users can select the time slot they wish to book.
- **User Input**: Accepts user input for CID (Citizen ID), court number, booking date, and desired time.

## How to Run
- npm install
- node index.js
